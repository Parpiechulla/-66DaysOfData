DAY1: 
Today I picked up from where I stopped on Kaggle courses and learnt how to use pipelines to keep data preprocessing and ML modeling codes organized. I made a prediction on cost of housing based on a melbourne housing data i found on kaggle with a mean absolute error 16366.58824, which is an improvement on my previous score of 21217.91640 which put me in the top 17% of participants on the scoreboard.
