DAY1: 
Today I picked up from where I stopped on Kaggle courses and learnt how to use pipelines to keep data preprocessing and ML modeling codes organized. I made a prediction on cost of housing based on a melbourne housing data i found on kaggle with a mean absolute error 16366.58824, which is an improvement on my previous score of 21217.91640 which put me in the top 17% of participants on the scoreboard.

DAY2:
Today I finished the 5th lesson of the kaggle intermediate machine learning course on cross-validation as a better measure for model performance. I donâ€™t have a full hang of it yet so I picked up this book to improve my ML foundation, itâ€™s looking like itâ€™s going to be a good read ðŸ˜ƒ.
